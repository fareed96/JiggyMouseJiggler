# Jiggy Mouse Jiggler

This is a simple **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** project that simulates various user activities in the browser:

- Random mouse movements  
- Random clicks on HTML buttons  
- Random key presses (neutral keys like Shift, Control)  
- Random text typing into an input field  
- Light CPU usage to mimic background processes  
- A rotating animation on a Canvas element

The idea is to keep your browser session looking “active.” However, this is purely a technical demonstration and not guaranteed to fool any advanced monitoring.
